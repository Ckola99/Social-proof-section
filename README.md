## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to properly position background images look below on how I managed this:

```CSS

body {
		display: grid;
		margin-inline: 1.5rem;
		max-width: 25rem;
		place-items: center;
		background: url(./images/bg-pattern-top-mobile.svg) top left 3.5rem, url(./images/bg-pattern-bottom-mobile.svg) bottom right;
		background-repeat: no-repeat;
	}

```

### Continued development

I really want to improve my layout skills as this challenge really CHALLENGED me and I feel my code is still a bit janky and isn't perfect on every screen therefore I need to work on my flexbox and grid understanding and skills.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - this website is what I used to make sure I used the correct selectors and available properties.
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) - I used chatgpt for small queries about my code where I couldn't necessarily see issues.
